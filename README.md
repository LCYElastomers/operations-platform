# Operations Platform

Modular operations management platform (Quality, Mechanical Integrity, and
future modules). See [`docs/AGENTS.md`](docs/AGENTS.md) for architecture,
security, and engineering principles.

This repository currently contains the project skeleton only: no
authentication, no data synchronization, and no module dashboards yet.

## Layout

```
apps/
  web/      Next.js (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, TanStack Query, shadcn/ui-ready)
  api/      FastAPI (Pydantic, SQLAlchemy 2, Alembic, pytest), managed with uv
compose.yml Docker Compose stack for web + api
docs/       Project guidelines
```

PostgreSQL is host-managed and is **not** part of the Compose stack.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Engine / Docker Desktop with Compose v2.24+
- For running outside Docker: Node.js 24 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

## Local startup (Docker Compose)

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # optional; defaults work without it
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps             # both services should report "healthy"
```

Then open:

- Frontend: <http://localhost:3000>
- API health: <http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health>
- API docs (non-production only): <http://localhost:8000/api/docs>

Stop the stack with `docker compose down`.

### How the stack is wired

- Both services join a private bridge network (`app`). Published ports are
  bound to `127.0.0.1` only, so nothing is reachable from other machines.
- The browser only talks to the web origin. Requests to `/api/*` are
  forwarded server-side by Next.js to `http://api:8000`, so no backend
  address or credentials reach client code. In production, Nginx will
  front both services the same way.
- Containers run as non-root users (`app`, UID 10001 for the API; `node`,
  UID 1000 for the web), with a read-only root filesystem, all Linux
  capabilities dropped, and `no-new-privileges`.
- Health checks: the API checks `/api/v1/health`; the web container checks
  `/`. The web service waits for the API to be healthy before starting.
- Both services use `restart: unless-stopped`.

Verify containers are not running as root:

```bash
docker compose exec api id    # uid=10001(app)
docker compose exec web id    # uid=1000(node)
```

## Running without Docker

API:

```bash
cd apps/api
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Web (in a second terminal):

```bash
cd apps/web
npm ci
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:3000, proxies /api to localhost:8000
```

Set `API_INTERNAL_URL` before `npm run dev` / `npm run build` to point the
proxy at a different API address.

## Checks

```bash
# API
cd apps/api
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .

# Web
cd apps/web
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run build
```

## Frontend structure

```
apps/web/src/
  app/                    Routes (App Router). Every page renders inside AppShell.
  config/navigation.ts    Single source of truth for the sidebar, breadcrumbs,
                          module cards, and module descriptions.
  components/layout/      AppShell, AppSidebar, AppHeader
  components/common/      PageHeader, MetricCard, FilterBar, DataTable,
                          TrendChart, StatusBadge, EmptyState
  components/modules/     ModuleNotConfigured (standard page for modules
                          without a connected data source)
  components/system/      API health status
  components/ui/          shadcn/ui primitives
  lib/                    API client, navigation helpers, utilities
```

To add a module page: register it in `config/navigation.ts`, then create the
route under `src/app`. Until real data is connected, render
`<ModuleNotConfigured href="..." />` rather than sample data.

Data conventions used by the shared components:

- `MetricCard` takes `value: number | null`. `null` renders as "no data";
  `0` renders as `0`.
- `DataTable` renders `null`/`undefined` cells as an explicit dash.
- `TrendChart` points with a `null` value are drawn as gaps, not zeros.

The sidebar is persistent at `lg` (1024px) and wider. Below that it becomes a
drawer opened from the header menu button.

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables; see
[`.env.example`](.env.example). `.env` files are git-ignored and excluded
from Docker build contexts. Never commit real credentials.

| Variable       | Used by | Default       | Notes                                   |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `WEB_PORT`     | compose | `3000`        | Host port, bound to 127.0.0.1           |
| `API_PORT`     | compose | `8000`        | Host port, bound to 127.0.0.1           |
| `ENVIRONMENT`  | api     | `development` | `production` disables API docs          |
| `LOG_LEVEL`    | api     | `INFO`        |                                         |
| `DATABASE_URL` | api     | _(unset)_     | SQLAlchemy URL for host PostgreSQL      |

## Database migrations

Alembic is configured in `apps/api/alembic`. It reads `DATABASE_URL` from the
environment; no URL is stored in `alembic.ini`. Register new models in
`app/models/__init__.py` so autogenerate can see them.

```bash
cd apps/api
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "describe change"
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

Use a least-privilege database role for the application. From inside the API
container, the host database is reachable as `host.docker.internal`.

## shadcn/ui

`apps/web/components.json`, the `cn()` helper in `src/lib/utils.ts`, and the
theme variables in `src/app/globals.css` are in place. Add components with:

```bash
cd apps/web
npx shadcn@latest add button
```
